RandomForest v. 0.0.10
======================

Copyright 2016 Henrik Bostr√∂m

A `Julia <http://julialang.org>`_ package that implements random forests for classification, regression and survival analysis with conformal prediction.
[NOTE: survival analysis under development]

There are two basic ways of working with the package:

- running an experiment with multiple datasets, possibly comparing multiple methods,
  i.e., random forests with different parameter settings, or

- working with a single dataset, to evaluate, generate, store, load or
  apply a random forest

All named arguments below are optional, while the others are mandatory.

The classification datasets included in uci.zip have been downloaded and adapted from:

The regression datasets included in regression.zip have been downloaded and adapted from the above source and from:
